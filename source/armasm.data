INSTRUCTION: ALL

add r0,r1,r2      // load r0 with r1+r2
add r0,r1,99      // load r0 with r1+99
adr r0,label      // load r0 with the address label (this actually calculates an address from the PC plus an offset)
bl label          // branch (with link) to label - this is a procedure / subroutine / function call
br label          // branch to label - this is a goto
br register       // branch to the address in register
b.eq label        // branch to label if equal
b.ne label        // branch to label if not equal
b.lt label        // branch to label if less
b.gt label        // branch to label if greater
cmp r0,r1         // compare register r0 with register r1. The comparison sets flags in the processor status register which affect conditional branches.
cmp r0,99         // compare the number 99 with register r0. The comparison sets flags in the processor status register which affect conditional branches.
ldr r0,[r1,0]     // load register r0 from the address pointed to by (r1 + (0 * size)) where size is 8 bytes for 64-bit stores, 4 bytes for 32-bit stores
ldr w0,[r1,0]     // like above but reads 32 bits only - note the use of w0 instead of r0 for the source register name
ldrb w0,[r1,0]    // like above but reads 1 byte (8 bits) only - note the use of w0 for the source register name
ldur r0,[r1,0]    // load register r0 from the address pointed to by (r1 + 0) - the mnemonic means "load unscaled register"
mov r0,r1         // move data from r1 to r0
mov r0,99         // load r0 with 99 (only certain immediate values are possible)
ret               // return from subroutine (counterpart to bl)
str r0,[r1,0]     // store register r0 to address pointed to by (r1 + (0 * size)) where size is 8 bytes for 64-bit stores
strb w0,[r1,0]    // like str but writes one byte only - note the use of w0 for the source register name
stur r0,[r1,0]    // store register r0 to the address pointed to by (r1 + 0) - the mnemonic means "store unscaled register"
svc 0             // perform a syscall
msub r0,r1,r2,r3  // load r0 with r3-(r1*r2) (useful for calculating remainders)
madd r0,r1,r2,r3  // load r0 with r3+(r1*r2)
mul r0,r1,r2      // load r0 with r1*r2 (actually an alias - see ARM ARM)
push r0           // push r0 onto the stack
pop r0            // pop r0 off the stack
udiv r0,r1,r2     // unsigned - divide r1 by r2, places quotient into r0 - remainder is not calculated (use msub)


END_INSTRUCTION: ALL

INSTRUCTION: STP LDP
** Load pair (LDP) and store pair (STP) **

These pair instructions transfer two registers to and from memory. The first instruction loads [X0] into W3, and loads [X0 + 4] into W7:

LDP        W3, W7, [X0]

This second instruction stores D0 into [X4] and stores D1 to [X4 + 8]:

STP        D0, D1, [X4]            

Load and store pair instructions are often used for pushing, and popping off the stack. This first instruction pushes X0 and X1 onto the stack:

STP        X0, X1, [SP, #-16]!

This second instruction pops X0 and X1 from the stack:

LDP        X0, X1, [SP], #16
Remember that in AArch64 the stack-pointer must be 128-bit aligned.
